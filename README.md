# -Data-Curation-and-Analysis-Project
The goal of this project is to collect data field major fields like the mining, agriculture, and manufacturing businesses to name a few, and use data to understand how much greenhouse gas emissions these types of companies typically omit CO2 into the atmosphere. By displaying visualizations like a scatter plot and histogram for this data allows a clear understanding on which industries produce the most greenhouse gasses and which one emit the least amount of CO2. 
The MIT licence was used which provides users/viewers of my project to use all code and data in my project. 
Data type and description for each attribute in your data:
anzsic_description - This column provides the type of industry that the data is collected for.
period - This column labels every quarter year that data is collected.
data_value - The numeric value of how many Kilotons of Cardon Dioxide each industry emits.
variable - This column provides an understanding that each season of the year has an influence on data collection.
units - Units used to collect data (Kilotonnes).
gas - This column states the greenhouse gasses that the different industries are emitting (CO2).
Data was mostly collected by GlobalData.com which provides public data with expert analysis for the world's largest industries.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency was also used to collect data.
Overall I could not detect any major bias from my sources in the data collection process.
